Description: Please analyze and describe the screenshot image in detail and then provide an overall image description. Pay attention to anything related to the current task. Focus on the combat situation, environmental hazards, available paths, and interactive elements. Note the player character's position and the state of nearby enemies.

Equipment: Note the currently equipped weapons and skills shown at the bottom of the screen, including their types and any visible cooldown status.

Resources: Report on visible resources including gold (coin icon), cells (blue cell icon), and any scrolls or blueprint counts displayed.

Enemy_information: Identify all visible enemies, their types (if recognizable), approximate positions relative to the player, and their apparent health status or attack patterns.

Environmental_elements: Describe relevant environmental features including platforms, ladders, spikes, traps, doors (normal, timed, or locked), teleporters, shops, food items, and any special interactive objects.

Combat_alerts: If there are some in-game combat alerts or warnings (such as "elite enemy detected" notifications, curse counters, or timed door countdowns), extract this information, otherwise, only output "null".

Map_status: Identify which biome the player is in based on the visual style, and if the map is open, describe the revealed areas and potential paths forward. If no map is visible, output "null".
