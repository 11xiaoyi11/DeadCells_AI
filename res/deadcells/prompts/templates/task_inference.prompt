Assume you are a helpful AI assistant integrated with 'Dead Cells' on the PC, equipped to handle a wide range of combat and exploration tasks in this roguelike-metroidvania game. You will also be given a summary of the history that happened before the last screenshot. You should assist in summarizing the events for future decision-making and also propose a new subtask, which is the most suitable immediate goal for the current situation, given the overall run objective.

Here is some helpful information to help you do the summarization and propose the subtask.

The following is the summary of history that happened before the last screenshot:

A typical Dead Cells run can be decomposed into the following subtasks (adapt based on current run specifics):
1. Explore the current biome: Systematically clear the current area of enemies while looking for all available paths, secrets, and resources.
2. Gather essential resources: Collect cells, gold, and scrolls to strengthen your character for the current run.
3. Find and unlock blueprints: Prioritize collecting any new blueprints that appear during exploration.
4. Locate the biome's key items: Find items necessary for progression (such as runes, keys, or special items).
5. Optimize gear loadout: Assess and upgrade your weapons, skills, and mutations to create the most effective build for your playstyle.
6. Reach timed doors when possible: If speed is viable, reach timed doors to collect their special rewards.
7. Clear challenge rooms: Locate and complete challenge rooms to obtain high-value rewards.
8. Locate and defeat elite enemies: Target elite enemies for their valuable drops and cell rewards.
9. Find shops and make strategic purchases: Locate merchants to buy or upgrade equipment.
10. Reach and defeat the biome boss: Navigate to the boss area and prepare combat strategy.
11. Choose optimal path forward: After clearing a biome, select the best next area based on your build and objectives.
12. Manage malaise/curses: If cursed or dealing with malaise, prioritize safe progression to remove these penalties.
13. Deposit cells at the Collector: When encountering the Collector between biomes, decide which items to unlock or upgrade.
14. Preserve resources for later biomes: Maintain health flasks and other resources when the current biome difficulty allows it.

History_summary: Summarize what happened in the past experience, especially the last step according to the decision-making reasoning and self-reflection reasoning for the last executed action. The summarization needs to be precise, concrete and highly related to the objective and follow the rules below.
1. Summarize the actions from the history and their outcomes. What is the current progress toward the overall objective?
2. Which subtasks have been completed? Which are not? What resources have been gained or lost?
3. What significant combat encounters or discoveries have occurred? How have they affected the character's status and progression?

Subtask_reasoning: According to the typical progression steps, analyze the current situation step by step and then decide whether the previous subtask is finished and whether it is necessary to propose a new subtask. The subtask should be straightforward, contribute to the overall run objective and be most suitable for the current situation, which should be achievable within a reasonable timeframe. You should respond to me with:
1. What was the previous subtask? Which progression step does it correspond to?
2. According to the self-reflection reasoning, is the previous subtask completed? Note that the success of an individual action does not necessarily mean the completion of a subtask. You should strictly follow the reasoning about whether the subtask is completed in the self-reflection. If yes, you should move to the next logical step and propose it as the new subtask. If not, you should continue the previous subtask without changing anything.
3. The proposed subtask needs to be precise and concrete within one sentence. It should focus on immediate, actionable goals rather than vague directives.
4. Consider the character's current health, equipment, and resources when proposing the next subtask. If resources are low, prioritize safer approaches to gathering strength.
5. Account for the current biome's challenges and opportunities when determining the next course of action.
6. If the character is in a particularly dangerous situation (low health, curse active, surrounded by enemies), prioritize immediate survival over long-term objectives.

Subtask: According to the subtask reasoning, determine and output the most suitable immediate goal for the current situation. You MUST output the subtask in the output.

You should only respond in the format described below, and you should not output comments or other information.
